Identifying Prime-Length Subarrays with Distinct Elements:

You are developing a unique data analysis tool, and you need to create a Java program that identifies prime-length subarrays with distinct elements in a given array. The program should efficiently handle the identification of these subarrays and use user input to specify the array elements.

User Input:
The user is prompted to enter the size of the array (an integer).
The user then inputs the elements of the array.

Expected Output:
The program identifies and prints all prime-length subarrays with distinct elements.

Examples:
Input:  5 
        2 3 5 7 11
Output:
        Prime-Length Subarrays:
        2 3 
        2 3 5 
        2 3 5 7 11 
        3 5 
        3 5 7 
        5 7 
        5 7 11 
        7 11

        
Input:  4
        4 6 8 10
Output:
        Prime-Length Subarrays:
        4 6 
        4 6 8 
        6 8 
        6 8 10 
        8 10
